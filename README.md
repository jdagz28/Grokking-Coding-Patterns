# Grokking Coding Patterns

My notes on Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns. This course is designed to enhance algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills. 

The course focuses on 16 common patterns in coding problems, providing a systematic approach to understanding the pattern in a problem so that students can code effectively and efficiently.

## Patterns 

| Index | Pattern                          | Description                                                                                     | Link to Folder                    |
|-------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0     | **Sliding Window**               | Solve subarray and substring problems using the sliding window technique.                      | [Sliding Window](./Sliding%20Window/) |
| 1     | **Two Pointers**                 | Solve problems using the two-pointer technique for optimized solutions.                        | [Two Pointers](./Two%20Pointers/)       |
